For most transports and socket types the connection is not performed immediately but as needed by Ã˜MQ. Thus a successful call to zmq_connect() does not mean that the connection was or could actually be established. Because of this, for most transports and socket types the order in which a server socket is bound and a client socket is connected to it does not matter. The first exception is when using the inproc:// transport: you must call zmq_bind() before calling zmq_connect(). The second exception are ZMQ_PAIR sockets, which do not automatically reconnect to endpoints.
